<h2><strong>My Experience and what you can expect from me</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>How It Works</strong></h2>
<p>
  The classic duration of a lesson is <strong>30 minutes</strong>. <br>
  This includes : <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>25 minutes</strong> of mockup interview, discussing basic interview subjects</li>
      <li><strong>5 minutes</strong> of live feedback, quickly pointing out what went very well and things to work on before next lesson (if need)</li>
      <li>A detailed report will be given to you after the lesson. Usually in the same day as the lesson.</li>
    </ul>
  The report will mainly contain what we discussed during the 5 minutes feedback, but with more details. I'll add resources to help you practice and improve your skills.
